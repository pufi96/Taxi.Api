# Taxi.Api

A software system that will be used by the employees of a taxi company in order to keep records of the business activities performed.
This software system will allow employees to track performance and enter rides, track earnings and profits, add and display vehicles as well as additional information about them, manage locations, and track employee information.
There are two groups of users: administrators and employees.
When logging in, an employed user starts a shift, can add the trips he made during that shift, and has an overview of his earnings during the month.
The administrator also has access to the same functionalities as employees and, in addition, can add employees and vehicles, monitor the condition of vehicles, add new locations, monitor the work of employees, and monitor the business of the company.
When an employee is created, he will get an email with an initial password for login.
